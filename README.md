# Pong videogame for FPGAs

In October of 2001 Merlintec had a booth at the FEALTEC (high tech fair) of
the city of São Carlos (in São Paulo, Brazil) and I had received a brand new
XESS XSA100 board with a Xilinx Spartan 2 100 FPGA but had no demos to show
on it. Since early videogames were implemented entirely in dedicated hardware
and the fair's public was used to videgames being a kind of computer running
software, a new implementation of Pong seemed like a good option.

The design evolved over the next few days during each lunch hour, with
the field on the first day, paddles and balls on the second, then PS/2
keyboard interface and finally the scores on the last day of the fair.

In 2016 there were discussions about writing a book around the AP9 processor
developed at ICMC-USP.

So Pong was ported to the Terasic DE2 115 board and then to the DE0 board and
the code was cleaned up to make it more interesting as an educational example
in the book.

Except for this file, all material in this respository is in Portuguese.
